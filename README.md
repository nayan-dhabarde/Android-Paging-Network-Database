# Android-Paging-Network-Database
The project demonstrates how you can implement paging and offline storage using Android paging library and Room persistence database. Also, it shows you how to refresh data when needed

## Overview
The project does not contain any Activity file and UI and focuses on code significant to Paging/Offline storage and refreshing data

```
Notes: The project is just for reference for what you can architect and not the one which you can download, build and run
```
Apart from using Dagger 2 I have tried to keep the project simple and not used kotlin coroutines for retrofit and Room which could have reduced the amount of code.
